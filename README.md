# ibm-course
I created this repository as part of a course that I completed on Coursera, offered by IBM Skills Network. The course taught me about Distributed Version Control Systems and how to use git with Github. I learnt how to create new branches, commit changes, use pull request, and merge branches after changes have been double-checked. 

I also learnt how to fork and clone repositories.
